# Simple-Two-Cylinder-Engine
Showcase of a simple two cylinder engine 3d model and its motion study.

The dimensions are approximate, tolerances are non-existent. This model is just meant to serve as a means of demonstration of the engine mechanism and its constituent basic parts. It is not guaranteed that it is 3D-printing ready, although I plan to make ot so in future.
